# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

## Project Purpose
The aim of this project is to create an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We aim to achieve the best results by evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used in this study.

## Data set
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains a total of 60,000 color images belonging to 10 different classes. These classes:
-Airplane
-Automobile
-Bird
-Cat
- Deer
- Born
- Frog
-Horse
-Ship
- Truck

The data set consists of 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

## Data Preprocessing
The data were normalized and divided into training and testing sets. Additionally, sample images from the training data set were visualized.

## Algorithm Used
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
- KNN is an algorithm that classifies using nearest neighbors. In this project, the KNN model was created and trained using 3 neighbors.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Shows the correct classification rate of the model.
- **Precision:** The rate of correct positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Rate of true positives.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
